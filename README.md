3D Reconstruction with Stereo Cameras

Authors: Zhongxia Yan, Peter Wang, Jeffrey Zhang.

Note: To run our code, simply run the ipynb;

To implement 3D reconstruction in your code, please put your data in ./data folder. 
Format:
$name1.jpg    object in left view;
$name2.jpg    object in right view;
$name1_K.mat  intrinsic matrix in left view;
$name2_K.mat  intrinsic matrix in right view;
$name_matches.txt  stereo matching result of the 2 images.

We will provide the matching code later. Meanwhile, please feel free to run your own stereo matching code.
